no need to show "loading more games..." if there is no games to show, and change text on loading spinner. there is bug on home page with loading more games, with lazy loading. only shows volleyball and tennis category, when scrolling downs shows loading more games but no game appear. can we achieve lazy loading with css content-visibility property and with that simplify javascript file? because I read: "When you lazy-load the container, and use content-visibility: auto on inner items, you get the best of both worlds: 🔄 Lazy load saves you from shipping the JS until it's needed. 👀 content-visibility saves the browser from wasting render cycles on offscreen DOM". if this works as we need maybe we do not need a lot of code. 1. The scrollbar-gutter CSS property allows authors to reserve space for the scrollbar, preventing unwanted layout changes as the content grows. can you implement scrollbar-gutter? 2. no need on sport category shifftig left on hover effect
