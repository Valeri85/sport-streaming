1. I am new in development, give me step by step, with good explanations
2. Do not add any feature in code by yourself, before discuss with me any feature.
3. After your answer on my prompt, sometimes there is an issue with artifact, code is not updated. that is why rewrite code in the file witch you edit every time you answer me to avoid technical problems.
4. Do not write documentation after every your answer.
