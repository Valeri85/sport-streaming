TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
========================================

ISSUE 1: Sport URLs showing ?sport=basketball instead of /live-basketball
------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAUSE: .htaccess file not working or mod_rewrite not enabled

FIX:

1. Upload .htaccess file to /streaming/ folder
   - Make sure it's named exactly ".htaccess" (with the dot)
   - File permissions should be 644

2. Test if mod_rewrite is enabled:
   - Upload test-rewrite.php to /streaming/
   - Visit: yourdomain.com/test-rewrite.php
   - Check if "mod_rewrite is enabled" shows ✓

3. If mod_rewrite is disabled:
   - Contact your hosting provider
   - Ask them to enable "mod_rewrite" module
   - Most shared hosting has this enabled by default

4. Clear browser cache:
   - Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Cmd+Shift+Delete on Mac)
   - Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Safari: Cmd+Option+E
   - Or use Incognito/Private mode

5. If still not working:
   - Check ISPmanager settings
   - Make sure .htaccess files are allowed
   - Try adding this to .htaccess:
     Options +FollowSymLinks


ISSUE 2: Favorites badge shows 0 on favorites page
---------------------------------------------------

CAUSE: Timing issue with JavaScript loading

FIX:

1. Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for any JavaScript errors
   - Check console logs for "Favorites loaded:" message
   - Should show games: X, leagues: Y, total: Z

2. If count is correct in console but not displayed:
   - Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check if localStorage is enabled in browser

3. Debug steps:
   - Go to homepage
   - Add a favorite (click ⭐)
   - Check if count badge updates
   - Click "Favorites" in sidebar
   - Open console (F12)
   - Look for "Updating favorites count:" messages
   - Should see multiple updates

4. If localStorage is blocked:
   - Check browser privacy settings
   - Disable "Block third-party cookies"
   - Try different browser


ISSUE 3: Favorites URL not showing count
-----------------------------------------

EXPECTED URLs:
- No favorites: /?favorites=1
- 1 favorite: /?favorites=1
- 2 favorites: /?favorites=2
- 5 favorites: /?favorites=5

The number in URL = total of favorited games + leagues
